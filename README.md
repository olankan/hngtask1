## Implementation Details

### Flutter InApp WebView Package

To enable internet access within the app itself and facilitate the "Open GitHub" button's functionality, I used the "flutter_inappwebview" package as a dependency. This package allows the app to display web content seamlessly within a WebView component, making it possible to access external web resources like your GitHub profile.

### Eva Icons Package

To incorporate the GitHub icon within the "Open GitHub" button, I utilized the "eva_icons_flutter" package. This package provides a wide range of customizable icons, including the GitHub icon.
